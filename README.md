# Boidz

A Swift implementation of Craig Reynolds' ["Steering Behaviors For Autonomous Characters"](http://www.red3d.com/cwr/steer/) aka Boids.

This implementation includes the following behaviors:

1. Separation  
2. Cohesion  
3. Alignment  
4. Bounding  

It uses [SpriteKit](https://developer.apple.com/spritekit/) for a 2D representation of the simulation. 

This is a simplified and Swiftified version of the AI I used to create the [Pangea Safari ecosystem simulation game](http://www.tembostudio.com/) pictured here:
